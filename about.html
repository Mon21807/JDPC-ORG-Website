                    <p>

                    <h3>Founding Days (1980s - 1992)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The journey began in the 80s with awareness drives in parishes, coordinated by Late Rev. Fr Mike Nwodo. In 1992, Archbishop Gabriel Ganaka appointed Fr Maurice Henry, who reorganized it into the Integral Development Commission (IDC) and introduced community-based training and education programs.
